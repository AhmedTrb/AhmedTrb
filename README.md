### ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed Trabelsi, a passionate and curious computer science student at the **National School of Computer Science (ENSI)**.

I have hands-on experience in web and app development through various projects and internships. During my internship at Graines Academy, We built an admin platform designed to facilitate user management operations. I also contributed to a startup as a solo talent part of the **Open Startup Tunisia program**, where I helped in building the MVP including API integrations, frontend development with Flutter, and testing.

These experiences, combined with my active participation in hackathons, have shaped my technical expertise in C++, JavaScript, and Python, as well as frameworks like React and Flutter.

### ðŸš€ My Journey
My journey started with an early fascination for technology, building simple games with Scratch and later learning C++ in High School. This laid the foundation for my participation in the **Tunisian Olympiads in Programming** a competitive programming competition for students under 18, where I discovered the thrill of tackling challenging problems and finding elegant solutions.

One of the most transformative experiences in my journey has been participating in hackathons too. These fast-paced, collaborative environments have given me the opportunity to work alongside talented peers, brainstorm innovative ideas, and turn those ideas into impactful projects. Each hackathon is a unique adventure, where I learn new technologies, solve complex problems, and craft solutions that can make a real difference.

Beyond hackathons, Iâ€™ve expanded my horizons by contributing to projects in fields like AI, machine learning, and web development. I am particularly fascinated by creating solutions that blend technology with real-world applications.

### ðŸŒ± What Drives Me
Curiosity fuels everything I do. Understanding how things work and learning to build them on my own, whether itâ€™s a simple app or a complex AI model. 

### Iâ€™m passionate about:

Building impactful projects that solve real-world problems.
Collaborating with like-minded people.
Participating in challenges that test the limits of creativity and skill.
